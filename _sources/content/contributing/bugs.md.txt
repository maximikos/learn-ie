## Bugs in the Brightway Code

First you must identify which package contains the bug you have found. You can do so by examining the Python Traceback, which is the error message that is displayed when the bug occurs. The traceback will contain the name of the package that contains the bug. This could be:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 1, in <module>
AttributeError: module 'bw2calc' has no attribute 'ComparativeMonteCarlo'
```

All Brightway packages are hosted in the [GitHub organization `brightway-lca`](https://github.com/brightway-lca). You can therefore:
