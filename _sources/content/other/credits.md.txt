Brightway was originally developed by [Chris Mutel](https://mutel.org/) during his doctoral research project. Brightway would have been possible without the incredibly generous support of [Professor Stefanie Hellweg](http://www.esd.ifu.ethz.ch/the-group/people/person-detail.html?persid=63817) of ETH Zürich. Today, Brightway is a highly active software ecosystem maintained by developers and life-cycle practitioners from academia and industry.
