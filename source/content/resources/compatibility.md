## I want to work with Brightway25 and the Activity Browser

This is currently not possible. The Activity Browser supports only the legacy Brightway2 framework. If you would like to voice your support for the Activity Browser to be updated to support Brightway25, check out [this discussion](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser/discussions/1174).
