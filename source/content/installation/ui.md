# User Interface (UI)

## (i)Python Shell

Brightway can be used from the interactive [iPython shell](http://ipython.org/).

## Jupyter Notebooks

Brightway is intended to be used primarily with [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/). These interactive Python-enabled lab notebooks open incredible possibilities for interactive, reproducible, collaborative, and understandable science.
## Graphical User Interface (Activity Browser)

```{note}
The Activity Browser user interface is currently compatible __only__ with the `legacy` version of Brightway (`brightway2`). To learn more, compare the article on [the difference between `brightway2` and `brightway 25`](../faq/brightway.md).
```

Brightway is a command-line tool intended primarily for use with [Jupyter Notebooks and the iPython shell](https://jupyter.org/). It does not provide a native graphical user interface. However, this functionality is provided by the Activity Browser project. To set up Activity Browser for use with Brightway, follow the [official installation instructions](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser#installation).
